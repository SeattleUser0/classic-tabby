# Classic Tabby — Linux build of SMK37 Open V01

Version: 0.7
Revision log:
- v0.7, 2026-11-01 (Step 8, end of Task 01): hardware readiness recorded read-only
  (section 8); no udev rule needed for Chrome WebMIDI/SysEx; the plugged-in device
  enumerates as "Orange Cat FM-1", not as an M-VAVE SMK-37 (open question).
- v0.6, 2026-11-01 (Step 7): host smoke tests (`tests/host/smoke.c`, native gcc build of
  the app + simulator sources with FM1_HOST_TEST) and `make test`; Makefile v0.3.
- v0.5, 2026-11-01 (Step 6): web workbench preview built with the Linux WASI SDK 27
  (`tools/linux/build-web.py`); simulator wasm byte-identical to the official release;
  preview verified in Chrome; Node check of the wasm; Makefile v0.2 (web, web-smoke).
- v0.4, 2026-11-01 (Step 5, Checkpoint C): Track B built from the toolchains folder (no
  /opt/jieli); A/B comparison: byte-identical; Track B is the default `make firmware`;
  top-level Makefile v0.1 (verify, firmware, firmware-native, firmware-ref, crosscheck,
  flash-budget, package-equivalence, clean).
- v0.3, 2026-11-01 (Step 4): official package reproduced byte for byte from the official
  source kit (`build.py --source-root`, v0.2); second-directory determinism result recorded;
  fork keeps LF line endings, so its build_id differs from official for that reason only.
- v0.2, 2026-11-01 (Checkpoint A): Wine installed, ~/.wine-jieli created, Track A build
  done and deterministic; package versions updated; flash/RAM baseline now from Track A.
- v0.1.2, 2026-11-01: PowerShell unavailable from Microsoft's repo for Ubuntu 26.04; pwsh
  equivalence test deferred (left to test); tar.gz alternative noted; install script v0.2.
- v0.1.1, 2026-11-01: added docs/FLASH-BUDGET.md reference and tools/linux/flash-budget.py.
- v0.1, 2026-11-01: created during Task 01. Steps 1 (repo) and 2 (host packages, partly
  blocked on sudo) done; Track A port written and verified against the native toolchain in
  a scratch build; official V01 release metadata captured; Track B toolchain pinned.

This file tracks what is done, what is left to build, what is left to test, exact package
versions, toolchain hashes, and the commands to reproduce the build from a clean Ubuntu
install. It is updated at every checkpoint. Scope and acceptance criteria: docs/SPEC.md.

Nothing in Task 01 touches device flash. Factory calibration and protected flash regions
are never written.

## 1. Status

### Done

- Step 1: upstream cloned to `firmware/` (remote `upstream`, tag `upstream-v01` =
  b2d6bcb "SMK37 OPEN V01"), branch `classic-tabby/linux-build`. `.gitattributes` intact.
  All 67 hashes in the `files` section of `sdk/manifest.json` verified against disk.
- Step 7 (**done**): `make test` = `host-smoke` + `web-smoke`. `host-smoke` compiles the 33
  app/web/third_party C units (the simulator's source set, `-DFM1_HOST_TEST -DFM1_OPEN_WEB`)
  natively with gcc 15.2 in 7 s together with `tests/host/smoke.c`, and runs it: it builds,
  the simulator initializes with cleared storage, SMK37 key 12 gives Note On 60 velocity
  100 on MIDI channel 1 (the default for keyboard track 0) on ports 0-2 and Note Off on
  release, the track's output channel moved to 3 through the MIDI settings makes the note
  follow (after the firmware's controller reset on the old channel), and audio renders.
  21 checks, all pass. The Makefile (v0.3) has verify, firmware, firmware-native,
  firmware-ref, crosscheck, web, web-smoke, host-smoke, test, flash-budget,
  package-equivalence, clean.
- Step 8 (**done, read only**): USB and ALSA enumeration recorded in section 8. Nothing
  was sent to or written on any device.
- Step 2 (partial): versions recorded below. Packages that need root are not installed yet
  (sudo requires an interactive password); `tools/linux/install-host-packages.sh` is the
  reproducible installer for a clean host.
- Step 3 (Track A, **Checkpoint A reached**): JieLi Windows toolchain 2.5.3 unpacked with
  innoextract (no Wine needed to extract); all 22 `external_toolchain` hashes match.
  Wine 10.0 (wine64 + wine32:i386) with a dedicated prefix `~/.wine-jieli` runs
  `clang.exe --version` (clang 4.0.1, target i686-pc-windows-msvc build), `pi32v2-ld.exe`
  (GNU ld 2.26.51.20160621), `llvm-nm.exe` and `llvm-objcopy.exe` (LLVM 4.0.1), and accepts
  Unix absolute paths as arguments (resolved through the `Z:` drive), so no path shim is
  needed. Option (b) chosen: `tools/linux/build.py` is a faithful Python port of
  `sdk/Build.ps1`; `tools/linux/package.py` ports `sdk/Package.cs`. Build time 12.6 s.
  Every Test-Firmware check passes; outputs in `build/pro/` (log: `build/track-a.log`).
  A second build in the same directory is bit-identical (sdk.elf e697dd67…, .fwsc b5bb4026…).
  The Track A ELF is also byte-identical to the native Linux toolchain build (Track B
  preview), which makes the A/B comparison in Step 5 trivial.
- Step 4 (**done**): official V01 Pro release fetched from open.m-vave.com (metadata,
  `.fwsc`, simulator, official source kit). Building the official source kit tree with
  Track A (`build.py --source-root <kit>`) reproduces the official package
  `SMK37_PRO_OPEN.fwsc` **byte for byte** (SHA-256 09fc9346…, 492084 bytes, build_id
  4c9e0084…). A build of the fork in a second, different directory gives a byte-identical
  `.fwsc` and `app-image.bin`; only the ELF symbol-table strings differ (section 5).
- Step 5 (**done, Checkpoint C**): JieLi Linux toolchain 20260730.1 downloaded, extracted
  and pinned in `tools/linux/toolchain-linux.json` (24 files). Used in place from
  `~/Documents/Classic Tabby/toolchains/` (not `/opt/jieli`, which would need sudo). Track B
  build: 4.0 s, every Test-Firmware check passes, and `sdk.elf`, `app-image.bin` and the
  `.fwsc` are **byte-identical to Track A** (section 5a). Track B is therefore the default
  `make firmware` target; Track A stays as `make firmware-ref` (output in `build/ref/`) and
  `make crosscheck` builds both and compares SHA-256.
- Step 6 (**done**): `tools/linux/build-web.py` ports `tools/Build-Web.ps1`; with the
  pinned Linux WASI SDK 27 (`FM1_WASI_SDK`, SHA-256 below) it builds
  `build/web/simulator.wasm` in 10 s and `build/preview/index.html` (1031406 bytes).
  The wasm is **byte-identical to the official V01 simulator** (b8b4a463…, 315420
  bytes). The preview loads in Google Chrome 156 (headless check: no console errors, the
  loading placeholder is hidden, the simulator generated 149 LCD targets and shows
  "Eight-track overview 01" with status "Browser preview · no device"; also opened in the
  desktop Chrome). `tests/simulator-wasm-smoke.mjs` run by `/usr/bin/node` (v22.23.3)
  boots the same wasm, presses key 12 and sees Note On 60 / Note Off 60 on MIDI channel 1
  on all three ports (section 5b).

### Left to build

- Package equivalence proof (`package.py` vs `sdk/Package.cs` through `pwsh`); deferred:
  PowerShell 7 is not installable from Microsoft's apt repository on Ubuntu 26.04 yet (the
  repo config .deb exists but carries no `powershell` package for this release). See
  "PowerShell without the apt repo" below. The Python packager is validated meanwhile by
  reproducing the official package byte for byte (Step 4), which exercises every code path
  of Package.cs on the real image.
- (nothing; Steps 1-7 complete)

### Left to test

- First flash of the Track B package on the SMK-37 Pro through the workbench (the user
  does this; see section 8 for the device question first).
- **pwsh packaging equivalence** (`make package-equivalence`: `tools/linux/package-pwsh.ps1`
  drives the original sdk/Package.cs via Add-Type on `build/pro/generated/app-image.bin`,
  compared byte for byte with `tools/linux/package.py`). Skipped until PowerShell 7 is
  available on this host.


## 2. Host packages (Ubuntu 26.04.1 LTS "resolute", kernel 7.0.0-42-generic)

| Package | Version | Source | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| git | 1:2.53.0-1ubuntu1.1 | Ubuntu | installed |
| build-essential | 12.12ubuntu2.26.04.2 (gcc 15.2.0) | Ubuntu | installed |
| python3 | 3.14.3-0ubuntu2 | Ubuntu | installed |
| nodejs (Node LTS) | 22.23.3-1nodesource1 (`/usr/bin/node`, v22.23.3) | nodesource repo (pre-existing) | installed; Homebrew node 25.6.1 shadows it in PATH, so the Makefile calls `/usr/bin/node` explicitly (`NODE=`) |
| powershell | — | Microsoft apt repo | **not available for Ubuntu 26.04** (repo config exists, no package); see below |
| wine64, wine32:i386, libwine | 10.0~repack-12ubuntu1 | Ubuntu | installed; prefix `~/.wine-jieli` |
| innoextract | 1.9-3 (apt); Homebrew 1.9_14 also present and first in PATH | Ubuntu / Homebrew | installed |
| p7zip-full (7zip) | 26.00+dfsg-1 | Ubuntu | installed; not needed (innoextract handles 2.5.3.exe) |
| alsa-utils | 1.2.15.2-1ubuntu1 | Ubuntu | installed |
| google-chrome-stable | 156.0.8078.73-1 | Google apt repo (pre-existing) | installed (not snap) |
| usbutils (lsusb) | 1:019-1 | Ubuntu | installed |

Install everything missing with:

```sh
sudo bash tools/linux/install-host-packages.sh
```

The PowerShell step is optional since script v0.2: a failure prints a warning and the
script continues with Wine and Chrome.

**PowerShell without the apt repo (not done yet).** Microsoft publishes a self-contained
build per release on GitHub: `https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases` →
`powershell-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz` (plus a `.sha256` file to verify). Install is:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /opt/microsoft/powershell/7
sudo tar -xzf powershell-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz -C /opt/microsoft/powershell/7
sudo chmod +x /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh
sudo ln -s /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh /usr/bin/pwsh
```

It needs only libicu (already present on Ubuntu desktop) and runs Add-Type (Roslyn)
normally, which is all `package-pwsh.ps1` requires. Record the version and SHA-256 here
when it is installed.

## 3. Toolchains and downloads

All archives live outside the repository in `~/Documents/Classic Tabby/toolchains/`.

| Item | URL | SHA-256 | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JieLi Windows toolchain 2.5.3 installer (Inno Setup 5.5.7) | https://jl-update.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/2.5.3.exe | 399bd518a28e47a7a0394506cebd5bf658748a58cd6b7c02512e24b4b88c5a5e | 52860672 |
| JieLi Linux toolchain 20260730.1 | https://pkgman.jieliapp.com/s/linux-toolchain → jieli-linux-toolchains-20260730.1.tar.xz | a1545cddbc451a06bac43eb5cd96d831470c42a97c5c0b1f98879a20fc7647bd | 26027508 |
| WASI SDK 27 (Linux x86_64) | https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/download/wasi-sdk-27/wasi-sdk-27.0-x86_64-linux.tar.gz | b7d4d944c88503e4f21d84af07ac293e3440b1b6210bfd7fe78e0afd92c23bc2 | 124790235 |

Layout after extraction:

- `toolchains/jieli-2.5.3/C$/JL/pi32` — the `pi32` directory with `bin/clang.exe`
  (`innoextract --extract --output-dir toolchains/jieli-2.5.3 2.5.3.exe`). All 22
  `external_toolchain` hashes from `sdk/manifest.json` match. clang.exe, pi32v2-ld.exe,
  llvm-nm.exe, llvm-objcopy.exe and LLVMgold.dll are PE32 (i386), so Wine needs 32-bit
  support.
- `toolchains/jieli-linux/jieli-linux-toolchains-20260730.1` — JieLi documents extracting it
  to `/opt/jieli` so that `/opt/jieli/common/bin/clang` exists. Pinned in
  `tools/linux/toolchain-linux.json` (generated by `tools/linux/pin-toolchain.py`):
  clang 4.0.1 (`common/bin/clang`, c45189ee…), `LLVMgold.so` (2ca8dafd…),
  `pi32v2/bin/ld` = GNU ld 2.26.51.20160621 with elf32-pi32v2 target (fd61aff1…),
  `pi32v2/bin/nm` = GNU nm 2.26.51 (32bee027…), `common/bin/objcopy` = LLVM 4.0.1 objcopy
  (29515122…), plus the 16 clang resource headers. The headers are the Windows ones with
  LF instead of CRLF line endings (identical after stripping `\r`).
- `toolchains/wasi-sdk-27.0-x86_64-linux` — clang 20.1.8-wasi-sdk, `share/wasi-sysroot`.

## 4. Commands

From the repository root (`~/Documents/Classic Tabby/firmware`). The Makefile (v0.1) wraps
the commands below; every path variable can be overridden on the command line
(`make firmware JIELI_LINUX=/opt/jieli`):

```sh
make verify           # manifest / synth.json / toolchain pin checks, both tracks
make firmware         # default: Track B (native) -> build/pro/
make firmware-ref     # Track A (Wine)            -> build/ref/pro/
make crosscheck       # both, then compare SHA-256 of sdk.elf, .fwsc, app-image.bin
make web              # build/web/simulator.wasm + build/preview/index.html (Linux WASI SDK 27)
make web-smoke        # /usr/bin/node tests/simulator-wasm-smoke.mjs build/web/simulator.wasm
make host-smoke       # gcc build of app + simulator sources with FM1_HOST_TEST, runs tests/host/smoke.c
make test             # host-smoke + web-smoke
make flash-budget     # build/pro/flash-budget.md (read only)
make clean
```

The underlying commands:

```sh
# Input checks only (SDK manifest, synth.json, toolchain pins)
python3 tools/linux/build.py --verify-only --toolchain-kind wine \
    --toolchain "$HOME/Documents/Classic Tabby/toolchains/jieli-2.5.3/C\$/JL/pi32"

# Track A: reference build, Windows toolchain under Wine (= sdk\Build.ps1 -Model pro -FirmwareOnly)
python3 tools/linux/build.py --model pro --firmware-only --toolchain-kind wine \
    --toolchain "$HOME/Documents/Classic Tabby/toolchains/jieli-2.5.3/C\$/JL/pi32" \
    --wine-prefix ~/.wine-jieli

# Track B: native Linux toolchain, pinned by tools/linux/toolchain-linux.json
python3 tools/linux/build.py --model pro --firmware-only --toolchain-kind native \
    --toolchain "$HOME/Documents/Classic Tabby/toolchains/jieli-linux/jieli-linux-toolchains-20260730.1"

# Step 6: web workbench local preview (= tools\Build-Web.ps1 -LocalPreview)
FM1_WASI_SDK="$HOME/Documents/Classic Tabby/toolchains/wasi-sdk-27.0-x86_64-linux" \
    python3 tools/linux/build-web.py --local-preview
google-chrome "file://$PWD/build/preview/index.html"

# Step 4: build another checkout (here: the official source kit, copied to a scratch dir)
# with this script and its own build directory. build.py v0.2.
python3 tools/linux/build.py --model pro --firmware-only --toolchain-kind wine \
    --toolchain "$HOME/Documents/Classic Tabby/toolchains/jieli-2.5.3/C\$/JL/pi32" \
    --wine-prefix ~/.wine-jieli --source-root /path/to/kit-copy --build-root /path/to/kit-build
```

Outputs: `build/pro/sdk.elf`, `sdk.map`, `firmware-report.json`, `package-report.json`,
`build-identity.json`, `compile_commands.json`, `link-arguments.json`,
`generated/SMK37_PRO_OPEN.fwsc` and `generated/app-image.bin` (raw image kept for the
package equivalence test).

## 5. Official V01 release (for Step 4)

Fetched 2026-11-01 from https://open.m-vave.com/smk37-workbench (static selector page
linking `releases/smk37/V01-fa2b726-07f2269d67d5/`). Saved under
`~/Documents/Classic Tabby/official-release/`.

Checkpoint A result: Track A `.fwsc` is 492084 bytes (same as official), SHA-256
b5bb4026b9c8f501cf97c6f7eea36925bb9220100295cfe06fe34b1d4f294afa, `cmp -l` against the
official package reports 46 differing bytes (the 32-byte `fm1_build_id` plus the CRC /
cipher bytes that depend on it).

### Step 4 result: official package reproduced

The official source kit (zip above, extracted to a scratch copy) built with Track A and
`build.py --source-root` gives:

| Output | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `generated/SMK37_PRO_OPEN.fwsc` | SHA-256 **09fc934630d9a3565966f533abeda6330abc4b6ed6801d746753383946cbb44b**, 492084 bytes — `cmp` against the official package: identical |
| `build-identity.json` | build_id 4c9e0084… (ordinal sort) — identical to the official metadata |
| `sdk.elf` | 6e5edc68e6222d64f6a71433ff20524367367dab981b1f1eeb5ddc9d9eb52c43 (loaded sections identical to the fork's build; only the identity bytes and the symbol-table path strings differ) |

So the whole Linux chain (Wine + JieLi 2.5.3 clang/ld, the Build.ps1 port and the
Package.cs port) is proven against M-VAVE's own release: the bytes they ship are the bytes
this chain produces.

**Why our fork's build_id differs from the official one, and only for that reason.** The
fork keeps the GitHub tree, where `.gitattributes` normalizes all SDK files to LF. The
official kit carries CRLF in `app/fm_factory.c` and `app/fm_library.c`. The build identity
hashes the raw bytes of every file under `app/`, so the fork's identity is
e3344029ab696c7395093fdddc5c3f949bbd47d8b605a78e6f691af664e0d12e instead of 4c9e0084….
The compiled code is identical (the ELF's `.text`, `.ram0_data` and every other loaded
section match byte for byte between the kit build and the fork build); only the 32
`fm1_build_id` bytes in the image and the package CRC/cipher bytes that depend on them
differ (46 bytes of 492084). The fork deliberately keeps LF.

### Step 4 result: determinism in a second directory

A fresh `git clone` of the fork in a different directory
(`/tmp/claude-1000/…/scratchpad/det-clone`) built with the same Track A command:

| Output | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `generated/SMK37_PRO_OPEN.fwsc` | byte-identical (b5bb4026…) |
| `generated/app-image.bin` | byte-identical |
| `build-identity.json`, `package-report.json`, `link-arguments.json` | identical |
| `sdk.elf` | differs only in `.strtab` / `.symtab`: the five `-fno-lto` objects (screen.c, transfer.c, midi_router.c, panel.c, scan.c) carry a `FILE` symbol with the absolute source path; `.text`, `.ram0_data`, `.boot_info`, `.cache_ram_data` and `.shstrtab` are identical |
| `sdk.map`, `compile_commands.json` | differ in paths only (the map also names the random `lto-llvm-xxxxxx.o` temp object) |

Source of the ELF nondeterminism: the compiler is given absolute source paths, exactly as
`sdk/Build.ps1` does on Windows (`C:\…\app\screen.c` in the official build). The
flashed image does not contain them. This is accepted as-is; the deterministic artefact is
the package, and `firmware-report.json` reports the ELF hash for information only.

Build identity finding: the identity is SHA-256 over `pro`, the manifest hash, and
`path:sha256` of every file under `app/` (sorted). From the GitHub checkout it comes out as
e3344029ab696c7395093fdddc5c3f949bbd47d8b605a78e6f691af664e0d12e, which does not match.
From the official source kit it comes out as 4c9e0084… — an exact match, with ordinal sort
order. The kit differs from GitHub only in line endings: `app/fm_factory.c` and
`app/fm_library.c` (and several web/third_party files) carry CRLF in the kit and LF in git
(`.gitattributes` normalizes to LF). The compiled code is unaffected; only the 32
`fm1_build_id` bytes in the image (and the package CRCs) differ. A byte-identical
reproduction of the official package therefore needs the kit's CRLF versions of those two
files; the GitHub tree gives the same machine code with a different identity.

### 5a. Checkpoint C: Track B toolchain and the A/B comparison

JieLi Linux toolchain `jieli-linux-toolchains-20260730.1` (archive SHA-256 a1545cdd…):

| Tool | Path in the archive | Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| clang | `common/bin/clang` (symlinked from `pi32v2/bin/clang`) | clang 4.0.1, host x86_64-linux; accepts `-target pi32v2 -mcpu=r3` (same PI32v2 clang 4.0.1 r3 target as the Windows 2.5.3 build) |
| ld | `pi32v2/bin/ld` | GNU ld 2.26.51.20160621, targets elf32-pi32v2 / elf32-pi32v2fdpic (= pi32v2-ld.exe) |
| LTO plugin | `common/bin/LLVMgold.so` | LLVM 4.0.1 gold plugin (= LLVMgold.dll) |
| nm | `pi32v2/bin/nm` | GNU nm 2.26.51 (Track A uses llvm-nm 4.0.1; same symbol output for the checks) |
| objcopy | `common/bin/objcopy` | LLVM objcopy 4.0.1 (= llvm-objcopy.exe) |

File limit: JieLi's README asks for `ulimit -n 8192` or more for linking; build.py raises
`RLIMIT_NOFILE` itself for native builds (the host default here is 524288 anyway).

Comparison, same source, same flags (`make crosscheck`):

| Output | Track A (Wine, reference) | Track B (native) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sdk.elf` | e697dd67a0e1bac86bc2256675bfe7c184f1a30853dd75a2c8fb8f8e07b6f697 | identical |
| `generated/SMK37_PRO_OPEN.fwsc` | b5bb4026b9c8f501cf97c6f7eea36925bb9220100295cfe06fe34b1d4f294afa | identical |
| `generated/app-image.bin` | 5a1a46825af608e352f30bd8ddba9c2c3d3bb09f3ef463d95fbbb44261af7301 | identical |
| section sizes / symbol placement / Test-Firmware | .text 377920, .ram0_data 75940, .ram0_bss 191356, .boot_info 52, .cache_ram_data 32; all checks pass | identical (same ELF) |
| build time | 12.6 s | 4.0 s |

The two toolchains are the same LLVM 4.0.1 / binutils 2.26.51 sources built for Windows
and Linux, so byte identity is plausible and was confirmed. Track B is the default
`make firmware`; Track A remains the reference and `make crosscheck` re-verifies identity
after any change to the build script or toolchain pins.

### 5b. Step 6: web workbench preview and the official simulator

| Output | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `build/web/simulator.wasm` | SHA-256 **b8b4a463e3149f9ea46e8e460a211e391a9a14c668221903a8f510d3aca98743**, 315420 bytes: identical to the official V01 simulator (`official-metadata.json` and the extracted `simulator-official.wasm`) |
| simulator `source_sha256` (fork, LF) | 78bda82981a96b36bb5de10a2c4febe6ffc5308e21fa827ebf10fef8e7589d9a |
| simulator `source_sha256` (official kit) | 0f8ffc3a51a5b7477914296111f8a90db9be9a9721a1057ef61047a8df8a766a — reproduced from the kit tree; the difference to the fork is CRLF in 10 of the 84 hashed inputs (`app/fm_factory.c`, `app/fm_library.c`, `third_party/synth/pluck.c`, `third_party/synth/voices.h`, `web/engine/sound.c`, `web/synth/adsr.c`, …), the same cause as the firmware build_id |
| `build/preview/index.html` | 1031406 bytes; source link replaced by "(local preview)" as upstream does |
| Chrome 156 headless (`--dump-dom`, 8 s virtual time) | no console errors; `#sim-placeholder` hidden; 149 `.lcd-target` elements generated by the simulator; `.sim-details` = "Eight-track overview 01"; `.device-status` = "Browser preview · no device" |
| Node 22.23.3 (`/usr/bin/node`) smoke | `_initialize`, `sim_boot(1)`, key 12 pressed: Note On 60 velocity 100 on channel 1, ports 0-2; release: Note Off 60; render output finite |

The Linux WASI SDK produces the same wasm as the Windows one (both clang 20.1.8-wasi-sdk
with the same sysroot), so the browser workbench is reproducible on Linux byte for byte.
Node is not needed to build the preview; upstream uses it only in `tools/Build-Hosted.cjs`
(static-site packaging of a distribution build, not part of Task 01).

### 5c. Step 7: host tests

`make host-smoke` compiles exactly the simulator's source set (every `.c` under `app/`,
`web/` and `third_party/synth/` except `app/board/`, with `-DFM1_HOST_TEST -DFM1_OPEN_WEB`
and the same include order as Build-Web.ps1 L82) with the host compiler (`CC`, default
gcc; clang works when installed) and links `tests/host/smoke.c` against it. `-Werror` is
not used in the host build because gcc rejects clang's `minsize` attribute and warns about
indentation in third_party; both are warnings only and the wasm build keeps `-Werror`.

The harness drives `web/engine/Simulator.c`'s `sim_*` entry points, the same ones the
browser calls, so the app code under test (`smk37_controls.c`, `midi_router.c`,
`project.c`, `screen.c`, …) runs unchanged. Checks (21, all pass):

| Area | Check |
| --- | --- |
| builds | 33 units + harness compile and link natively (7 s) |
| initializes | `sim_boot(1)`; panel snapshot readable; 128-frame blocks; LCD target table; keyboard track 0 on channel 1; destinations = ports 0-2; KEY OUT on |
| keyboard note | key 12 velocity 100 → `90 3C 64` on ports 0, 1, 2; nothing on another channel; release → `80 3C 00` |
| expected channel | `sim_midi_edit(0, 1, +2)` moves track 0 to channel 3; the firmware first sends its controller reset on channel 1 (`B0 78 00` all sound off, sustain/mod/bend/pressure neutral, stop); then key 12 → `92 3C 64` / `82 3C 00` |
| audio | one rendered block, all values finite |

Finding worth knowing for Phase 1: a MIDI settings change resets the previous channel
and releases held notes on the next 10 ms poll. The test waits for that, as a player would.

## 6. Flash / RAM baseline (Track A and Track B, identical)

From `build/pro/firmware-report.json` and `package-report.json` of the Track A build
(identical to the native-toolchain build):

| Quantity | Value |
| --- | --- |
| app image (.text 377920 + .ram0_data 75940 + .cache_ram_data 32) | 453892 bytes |
| hard app limit from Package.cs (0xff000 − USER − BTIF − min VM − area − header − cfg − 64) | 453921 bytes (margin 29 bytes) |
| FLASH_BIN_SIZE / VM_START | 471040 (0x73000) |
| VM region | 471040–503808 = 32768 bytes (exactly the 32768 minimum; vm_extra_gap 0) |
| BTIF | 503808–507904 (4096) |
| USER region | 507904–1044480 (536576 bytes, untouched by the package) |
| runtime heap (_MALLOC_SIZE) | 256268 bytes (minimum 49152) |
| internal SRAM 0x01c00000–0x01c80000 | sections 267348 bytes (.ram0_data 75940 + .ram0_bss 191356 + .boot_info 52); heap 256268 bytes follows the bss up to _HEAP_END; 524288 − 267348 = 256940 bytes not statically allocated, of which the heap takes 256268 |

The V01 image sits at the very top of the flash layout: one more 4 KiB page of code would
fail `Insufficient FM1 settings space` in Package.cs. This is the single most important
constraint for Phase 1 work. The per-input breakdown, savings estimates and the USER-region
layout are in [FLASH-BUDGET.md](FLASH-BUDGET.md) (generated tables:
`tools/linux/flash-budget.py`).

## 8. Hardware readiness (Step 8, read only, 2026-11-01)

Commands run: `lsusb`, `amidi -l`, `aconnect -l`, `cat /proc/asound/cards`, and reads of
`/sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/*`. No MIDI message (not even an identity request) was sent, and
nothing was written to any device.

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| USB devices (besides hubs) | 046d:c52b Logitech Unifying Receiver; 2321:0022 iConnectivity AUDIO4c; 8087:0a2b Intel Bluetooth; **1209:0001 "Generic pid.codes Test PID"** (bus 1, device 37, full speed, bus-powered 100 mA) |
| 1209:0001 descriptors | manufacturer "Orange Cat", product **"Orange Cat FM-1"**, no serial, bcdDevice 3.30, 5 interfaces: Audio Control, MIDI Streaming, Audio Control, 2 × Audio Streaming; all bound to `snd-usb-audio` |
| ALSA card | card 1 `FM1` "Orange Cat FM-1" (USB-Audio); `amidi -l`: `hw:1,0,0` "Orange Cat FM-1 MIDI 1" (IO); `aconnect -l`: client 20 "Orange Cat FM-1", port 0 |
| other MIDI | AUDIO4c client 24 with DIN, USB2, HST1-8 ports; PipeWire sequencer clients 142/143 |
| device permissions | `/dev/snd/seq` and `/dev/snd/midiC1D0` are `root:audio 0660` with a logind ACL `user:userzero:rw-` (seat session), so Chrome can open them without group membership changes; `/dev/bus/usb/001/037` is `root:root 0664` (not needed) |
| udev rule | **not needed.** The workbench uses WebMIDI (`navigator.requestMIDIAccess({sysex:true})` in `sdk/Update.html.in`), which Chrome on Linux serves through the ALSA sequencer, not WebUSB/WebHID. Chrome will show its own per-site SysEx permission prompt. Nothing was added under `/etc/udev/rules.d/` |
| firmware version | **not visible from descriptors as an M-VAVE version.** The only candidate device identifies itself as "Orange Cat FM-1" with USB VID/PID 1209:0001 (pid.codes test ID) and bcdDevice 3.30. The stock V16 and the Open V01 images carry the strings "M-VAVE" and "SMK-37 Pro_8000001" (found in `build/pro/generated/app-image.bin`); no such strings exist in the enumerated device. Either the SMK-37 Pro currently runs the Orange Cat firmware (the user's other project), or the plugged-in unit is the Orange Cat FM-1 and the SMK-37 Pro is not connected. Reading the version through the workbench would require sending SysEx to the device, which Step 8 forbids, so this is left as an open question for the user |

## 7. Windows-specific items found in the upstream build and how they are handled

| Item | Where | Handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PowerShell 5.1 host (`powershell` in build.bat) | build.bat, sdk/Build.ps1, tools/Build-Web.ps1 | Build.ps1 ported to `tools/linux/build.py`; Build-Web.ps1 port pending (Step 6); top-level Makefile replaces build.bat |
| `/opt/jieli` install location and `ulimit -n` | JieLi Linux toolchain README | used in place from the toolchains folder (`--toolchain`), RLIMIT_NOFILE raised by build.py |
| C# packager loaded with Add-Type | sdk/Package.cs | Ported to `tools/linux/package.py`; `tools/linux/package-pwsh.ps1` runs the original under pwsh for the equivalence test |
| `.exe` tool names and `LLVMgold.dll` plugin | Build.ps1 L36, L241, L307, L422, L436 | Track A keeps the names and runs them through Wine; Track B maps them in toolchain-linux.json |
| `StartsWith($sdk + '\')` manifest path check | Build.ps1 L342 | `os.sep` prefix check |
| `StartsWith($root + '\build\')` object directory guard | Build.ps1 L364 | `os.sep` prefix check, honouring `--build-root` |
| `app/synth` exclusion with `'\'` suffix | Build.ps1 L357 | `os.sep` prefix check |
| `Sort-Object FullName` (culture-sensitive) | Build.ps1 L357, L401 | ordinal sort; proven correct by reproducing the official build_id (`--identity-sort culture` kept for reference) |
| 22 Windows toolchain hashes | sdk/manifest.json, sdk/synth.json | Track A: enforced unchanged. Track B: replaced by `tools/linux/toolchain-linux.json`; every SDK file check and every synth.json check except the installed-compiler hash remains |
| `curl.exe`, `tar.exe`, Windows WASI SDK (`wasi-sdk-27.0-x86_64-windows.tar.gz`, `bin/clang.exe`) | Build-Web.ps1 L42-L62 | `tools/linux/build-web.py`: Linux archive pinned (b7d4d944…), `curl` / `tar` from the Ubuntu archive, `bin/clang`; set `FM1_WASI_SDK` to skip the download |
| .NET `LastWriteTimeUtc.Ticks` in the wasm cache stamp; `\\?\` long-path prefix | Build-Web.ps1 L64-L68 | size + mtime_ns stamp; no prefix needed |
| `[Net.WebUtility]::HtmlEncode` | Build-Web.ps1 L128, L141 | re-implemented with the same rules in build-web.py |
| `tools/Build-Hosted.cjs` run by Node | hosting step | not needed for the preview; `/usr/bin/node` v22.23.3 recorded for the tests |
| CRLF in the official kit's app files | official source zip | Documented in section 5; the fork keeps LF and therefore a different build_id; no change to app/ |
| Absolute source paths in the ELF symbol table | Build.ps1 L360-L370 (compile command) | Same behaviour on Linux; package unaffected (section 5, determinism) |
