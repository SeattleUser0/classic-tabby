# Classic Tabby — Linux build of SMK37 Open V01

Version: 0.3
Revision log:
- v0.3, 2026-11-01 (Step 4): official package reproduced byte for byte from the official
  source kit (`build.py --source-root`, v0.2); second-directory determinism result recorded;
  fork keeps LF line endings, so its build_id differs from official for that reason only.
- v0.2, 2026-11-01 (Checkpoint A): Wine installed, ~/.wine-jieli created, Track A build
  done and deterministic; package versions updated; flash/RAM baseline now from Track A.
- v0.1.2, 2026-11-01: PowerShell unavailable from Microsoft's repo for Ubuntu 26.04; pwsh
  equivalence test deferred (left to test); tar.gz alternative noted; install script v0.2.
- v0.1.1, 2026-11-01: added docs/FLASH-BUDGET.md reference and tools/linux/flash-budget.py.
- v0.1, 2026-11-01: created during Task 01. Steps 1 (repo) and 2 (host packages, partly
  blocked on sudo) done; Track A port written and verified against the native toolchain in
  a scratch build; official V01 release metadata captured; Track B toolchain pinned.

This file tracks what is done, what is left to build, what is left to test, exact package
versions, toolchain hashes, and the commands to reproduce the build from a clean Ubuntu
install. It is updated at every checkpoint. Scope and acceptance criteria: docs/SPEC.md.

Nothing in Task 01 touches device flash. Factory calibration and protected flash regions
are never written.

## 1. Status

### Done

- Step 1: upstream cloned to `firmware/` (remote `upstream`, tag `upstream-v01` =
  b2d6bcb "SMK37 OPEN V01"), branch `classic-tabby/linux-build`. `.gitattributes` intact.
  All 67 hashes in the `files` section of `sdk/manifest.json` verified against disk.
- Step 2 (partial): versions recorded below. Packages that need root are not installed yet
  (sudo requires an interactive password); `tools/linux/install-host-packages.sh` is the
  reproducible installer for a clean host.
- Step 3 (Track A, **Checkpoint A reached**): JieLi Windows toolchain 2.5.3 unpacked with
  innoextract (no Wine needed to extract); all 22 `external_toolchain` hashes match.
  Wine 10.0 (wine64 + wine32:i386) with a dedicated prefix `~/.wine-jieli` runs
  `clang.exe --version` (clang 4.0.1, target i686-pc-windows-msvc build), `pi32v2-ld.exe`
  (GNU ld 2.26.51.20160621), `llvm-nm.exe` and `llvm-objcopy.exe` (LLVM 4.0.1), and accepts
  Unix absolute paths as arguments (resolved through the `Z:` drive), so no path shim is
  needed. Option (b) chosen: `tools/linux/build.py` is a faithful Python port of
  `sdk/Build.ps1`; `tools/linux/package.py` ports `sdk/Package.cs`. Build time 12.6 s.
  Every Test-Firmware check passes; outputs in `build/pro/` (log: `build/track-a.log`).
  A second build in the same directory is bit-identical (sdk.elf e697dd67…, .fwsc b5bb4026…).
  The Track A ELF is also byte-identical to the native Linux toolchain build (Track B
  preview), which makes the A/B comparison in Step 5 trivial.
- Step 4 (**done**): official V01 Pro release fetched from open.m-vave.com (metadata,
  `.fwsc`, simulator, official source kit). Building the official source kit tree with
  Track A (`build.py --source-root <kit>`) reproduces the official package
  `SMK37_PRO_OPEN.fwsc` **byte for byte** (SHA-256 09fc9346…, 492084 bytes, build_id
  4c9e0084…). A build of the fork in a second, different directory gives a byte-identical
  `.fwsc` and `app-image.bin`; only the ELF symbol-table strings differ (section 5).
- Step 5 (preparation): JieLi Linux toolchain 20260730.1 downloaded, extracted and pinned in
  `tools/linux/toolchain-linux.json` (24 files).
- Step 6 (preparation): WASI SDK 27 (Linux x86_64) downloaded and extracted; SHA-256 below.

### Left to build

- Package equivalence proof (`package.py` vs `sdk/Package.cs` through `pwsh`); deferred:
  PowerShell 7 is not installable from Microsoft's apt repository on Ubuntu 26.04 yet (the
  repo config .deb exists but carries no `powershell` package for this release). See
  "PowerShell without the apt repo" below. The Python packager is validated meanwhile by
  reproducing the official package byte for byte (Step 4), which exercises every code path
  of Package.cs on the real image.
- Track B build from `~/Documents/Classic Tabby/toolchains/` (not `/opt/jieli`: no sudo
  needed) and the A/B comparison; Track B becomes the default `make firmware` target.
- Web workbench local preview with the Linux WASI SDK (`tools/linux/build-web.py`).
- Host test target and top-level Makefile.

### Left to test

- **pwsh packaging equivalence** (`make package-equivalence`: `tools/linux/package-pwsh.ps1`
  drives the original sdk/Package.cs via Add-Type on `build/pro/generated/app-image.bin`,
  compared byte for byte with `tools/linux/package.py`). Skipped until PowerShell 7 is
  available on this host.

- Preview loads in Chrome and the simulator runs.
- Hardware enumeration (read only).

## 2. Host packages (Ubuntu 26.04.1 LTS "resolute", kernel 7.0.0-42-generic)

| Package | Version | Source | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| git | 1:2.53.0-1ubuntu1.1 | Ubuntu | installed |
| build-essential | 12.12ubuntu2.26.04.2 (gcc 15.2.0) | Ubuntu | installed |
| python3 | 3.14.3-0ubuntu2 | Ubuntu | installed |
| nodejs (Node LTS) | 22.23.3-1nodesource1 (`/usr/bin/node`) | nodesource repo (pre-existing) | installed; Homebrew node 25.6.1 shadows it in PATH |
| powershell | — | Microsoft apt repo | **not available for Ubuntu 26.04** (repo config exists, no package); see below |
| wine64, wine32:i386, libwine | 10.0~repack-12ubuntu1 | Ubuntu | installed; prefix `~/.wine-jieli` |
| innoextract | 1.9-3 (apt); Homebrew 1.9_14 also present and first in PATH | Ubuntu / Homebrew | installed |
| p7zip-full (7zip) | 26.00+dfsg-1 | Ubuntu | installed; not needed (innoextract handles 2.5.3.exe) |
| alsa-utils | 1.2.15.2-1ubuntu1 | Ubuntu | installed |
| google-chrome-stable | 156.0.8078.73-1 | Google apt repo (pre-existing) | installed (not snap) |
| usbutils (lsusb) | 1:019-1 | Ubuntu | installed |

Install everything missing with:

```sh
sudo bash tools/linux/install-host-packages.sh
```

The PowerShell step is optional since script v0.2: a failure prints a warning and the
script continues with Wine and Chrome.

**PowerShell without the apt repo (not done yet).** Microsoft publishes a self-contained
build per release on GitHub: `https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases` →
`powershell-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz` (plus a `.sha256` file to verify). Install is:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /opt/microsoft/powershell/7
sudo tar -xzf powershell-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz -C /opt/microsoft/powershell/7
sudo chmod +x /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh
sudo ln -s /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh /usr/bin/pwsh
```

It needs only libicu (already present on Ubuntu desktop) and runs Add-Type (Roslyn)
normally, which is all `package-pwsh.ps1` requires. Record the version and SHA-256 here
when it is installed.

## 3. Toolchains and downloads

All archives live outside the repository in `~/Documents/Classic Tabby/toolchains/`.

| Item | URL | SHA-256 | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JieLi Windows toolchain 2.5.3 installer (Inno Setup 5.5.7) | https://jl-update.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/2.5.3.exe | 399bd518a28e47a7a0394506cebd5bf658748a58cd6b7c02512e24b4b88c5a5e | 52860672 |
| JieLi Linux toolchain 20260730.1 | https://pkgman.jieliapp.com/s/linux-toolchain → jieli-linux-toolchains-20260730.1.tar.xz | a1545cddbc451a06bac43eb5cd96d831470c42a97c5c0b1f98879a20fc7647bd | 26027508 |
| WASI SDK 27 (Linux x86_64) | https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/download/wasi-sdk-27/wasi-sdk-27.0-x86_64-linux.tar.gz | b7d4d944c88503e4f21d84af07ac293e3440b1b6210bfd7fe78e0afd92c23bc2 | 124790235 |

Layout after extraction:

- `toolchains/jieli-2.5.3/C$/JL/pi32` — the `pi32` directory with `bin/clang.exe`
  (`innoextract --extract --output-dir toolchains/jieli-2.5.3 2.5.3.exe`). All 22
  `external_toolchain` hashes from `sdk/manifest.json` match. clang.exe, pi32v2-ld.exe,
  llvm-nm.exe, llvm-objcopy.exe and LLVMgold.dll are PE32 (i386), so Wine needs 32-bit
  support.
- `toolchains/jieli-linux/jieli-linux-toolchains-20260730.1` — JieLi documents extracting it
  to `/opt/jieli` so that `/opt/jieli/common/bin/clang` exists. Pinned in
  `tools/linux/toolchain-linux.json` (generated by `tools/linux/pin-toolchain.py`):
  clang 4.0.1 (`common/bin/clang`, c45189ee…), `LLVMgold.so` (2ca8dafd…),
  `pi32v2/bin/ld` = GNU ld 2.26.51.20160621 with elf32-pi32v2 target (fd61aff1…),
  `pi32v2/bin/nm` = GNU nm 2.26.51 (32bee027…), `common/bin/objcopy` = LLVM 4.0.1 objcopy
  (29515122…), plus the 16 clang resource headers. The headers are the Windows ones with
  LF instead of CRLF line endings (identical after stripping `\r`).
- `toolchains/wasi-sdk-27.0-x86_64-linux` — clang 20.1.8-wasi-sdk, `share/wasi-sysroot`.

## 4. Commands

From the repository root (`~/Documents/Classic Tabby/firmware`):

```sh
# Input checks only (SDK manifest, synth.json, toolchain pins)
python3 tools/linux/build.py --verify-only --toolchain-kind wine \
    --toolchain "$HOME/Documents/Classic Tabby/toolchains/jieli-2.5.3/C\$/JL/pi32"

# Track A: reference build, Windows toolchain under Wine (= sdk\Build.ps1 -Model pro -FirmwareOnly)
python3 tools/linux/build.py --model pro --firmware-only --toolchain-kind wine \
    --toolchain "$HOME/Documents/Classic Tabby/toolchains/jieli-2.5.3/C\$/JL/pi32" \
    --wine-prefix ~/.wine-jieli

# Track B: native Linux toolchain, pinned by tools/linux/toolchain-linux.json
python3 tools/linux/build.py --model pro --firmware-only --toolchain-kind native \
    --toolchain "$HOME/Documents/Classic Tabby/toolchains/jieli-linux/jieli-linux-toolchains-20260730.1"

# Step 4: build another checkout (here: the official source kit, copied to a scratch dir)
# with this script and its own build directory. build.py v0.2.
python3 tools/linux/build.py --model pro --firmware-only --toolchain-kind wine \
    --toolchain "$HOME/Documents/Classic Tabby/toolchains/jieli-2.5.3/C\$/JL/pi32" \
    --wine-prefix ~/.wine-jieli --source-root /path/to/kit-copy --build-root /path/to/kit-build
```

Outputs: `build/pro/sdk.elf`, `sdk.map`, `firmware-report.json`, `package-report.json`,
`build-identity.json`, `compile_commands.json`, `link-arguments.json`,
`generated/SMK37_PRO_OPEN.fwsc` and `generated/app-image.bin` (raw image kept for the
package equivalence test).

Fetched 2026-11-01 from https://open.m-vave.com/smk37-workbench (static selector page
linking `releases/smk37/V01-fa2b726-07f2269d67d5/`). Saved under
`~/Documents/Classic Tabby/official-release/`.

Checkpoint A result: Track A `.fwsc` is 492084 bytes (same as official), SHA-256
b5bb4026b9c8f501cf97c6f7eea36925bb9220100295cfe06fe34b1d4f294afa, `cmp -l` against the
official package reports 46 differing bytes (the 32-byte `fm1_build_id` plus the CRC /
cipher bytes that depend on it).

### Step 4 result: official package reproduced

The official source kit (zip above, extracted to a scratch copy) built with Track A and
`build.py --source-root` gives:

| Output | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `generated/SMK37_PRO_OPEN.fwsc` | SHA-256 **09fc934630d9a3565966f533abeda6330abc4b6ed6801d746753383946cbb44b**, 492084 bytes — `cmp` against the official package: identical |
| `build-identity.json` | build_id 4c9e0084… (ordinal sort) — identical to the official metadata |
| `sdk.elf` | 6e5edc68e6222d64f6a71433ff20524367367dab981b1f1eeb5ddc9d9eb52c43 (loaded sections identical to the fork's build; only the identity bytes and the symbol-table path strings differ) |

So the whole Linux chain (Wine + JieLi 2.5.3 clang/ld, the Build.ps1 port and the
Package.cs port) is proven against M-VAVE's own release: the bytes they ship are the bytes
this chain produces.

**Why our fork's build_id differs from the official one, and only for that reason.** The
fork keeps the GitHub tree, where `.gitattributes` normalizes all SDK files to LF. The
official kit carries CRLF in `app/fm_factory.c` and `app/fm_library.c`. The build identity
hashes the raw bytes of every file under `app/`, so the fork's identity is
e3344029ab696c7395093fdddc5c3f949bbd47d8b605a78e6f691af664e0d12e instead of 4c9e0084….
The compiled code is identical (the ELF's `.text`, `.ram0_data` and every other loaded
section match byte for byte between the kit build and the fork build); only the 32
`fm1_build_id` bytes in the image and the package CRC/cipher bytes that depend on them
differ (46 bytes of 492084). The fork deliberately keeps LF.

### Step 4 result: determinism in a second directory

A fresh `git clone` of the fork in a different directory
(`/tmp/claude-1000/…/scratchpad/det-clone`) built with the same Track A command:

| Output | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `generated/SMK37_PRO_OPEN.fwsc` | byte-identical (b5bb4026…) |
| `generated/app-image.bin` | byte-identical |
| `build-identity.json`, `package-report.json`, `link-arguments.json` | identical |
| `sdk.elf` | differs only in `.strtab` / `.symtab`: the five `-fno-lto` objects (screen.c, transfer.c, midi_router.c, panel.c, scan.c) carry a `FILE` symbol with the absolute source path; `.text`, `.ram0_data`, `.boot_info`, `.cache_ram_data` and `.shstrtab` are identical |
| `sdk.map`, `compile_commands.json` | differ in paths only (the map also names the random `lto-llvm-xxxxxx.o` temp object) |

Source of the ELF nondeterminism: the compiler is given absolute source paths, exactly as
`sdk/Build.ps1` does on Windows (`C:\…\app\screen.c` in the official build). The
flashed image does not contain them. This is accepted as-is; the deterministic artefact is
the package, and `firmware-report.json` reports the ELF hash for information only.

Build identity finding: the identity is SHA-256 over `pro`, the manifest hash, and
`path:sha256` of every file under `app/` (sorted). From the GitHub checkout it comes out as
e3344029ab696c7395093fdddc5c3f949bbd47d8b605a78e6f691af664e0d12e, which does not match.
From the official source kit it comes out as 4c9e0084… — an exact match, with ordinal sort
order. The kit differs from GitHub only in line endings: `app/fm_factory.c` and
`app/fm_library.c` (and several web/third_party files) carry CRLF in the kit and LF in git
(`.gitattributes` normalizes to LF). The compiled code is unaffected; only the 32
`fm1_build_id` bytes in the image (and the package CRCs) differ. A byte-identical
reproduction of the official package therefore needs the kit's CRLF versions of those two
files; the GitHub tree gives the same machine code with a different identity.

## 6. Flash / RAM baseline (Track A, Checkpoint A)

From `build/pro/firmware-report.json` and `package-report.json` of the Track A build
(identical to the native-toolchain build):

| Quantity | Value |
| --- | --- |
| app image (.text 377920 + .ram0_data 75940 + .cache_ram_data 32) | 453892 bytes |
| hard app limit from Package.cs (0xff000 − USER − BTIF − min VM − area − header − cfg − 64) | 453921 bytes (margin 29 bytes) |
| FLASH_BIN_SIZE / VM_START | 471040 (0x73000) |
| VM region | 471040–503808 = 32768 bytes (exactly the 32768 minimum; vm_extra_gap 0) |
| BTIF | 503808–507904 (4096) |
| USER region | 507904–1044480 (536576 bytes, untouched by the package) |
| runtime heap (_MALLOC_SIZE) | 256268 bytes (minimum 49152) |
| internal SRAM 0x01c00000–0x01c80000 | sections 267348 bytes (.ram0_data 75940 + .ram0_bss 191356 + .boot_info 52); heap 256268 bytes follows the bss up to _HEAP_END; 524288 − 267348 = 256940 bytes not statically allocated, of which the heap takes 256268 |

The V01 image sits at the very top of the flash layout: one more 4 KiB page of code would
fail `Insufficient FM1 settings space` in Package.cs. This is the single most important
constraint for Phase 1 work. The per-input breakdown, savings estimates and the USER-region
layout are in [FLASH-BUDGET.md](FLASH-BUDGET.md) (generated tables:
`tools/linux/flash-budget.py`).

## 7. Windows-specific items found in the upstream build and how they are handled

| Item | Where | Handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PowerShell 5.1 host (`powershell` in build.bat) | build.bat, sdk/Build.ps1, tools/Build-Web.ps1 | Build.ps1 ported to `tools/linux/build.py`; Build-Web.ps1 port pending (Step 6) |
| C# packager loaded with Add-Type | sdk/Package.cs | Ported to `tools/linux/package.py`; `tools/linux/package-pwsh.ps1` runs the original under pwsh for the equivalence test |
| `.exe` tool names and `LLVMgold.dll` plugin | Build.ps1 L36, L241, L307, L422, L436 | Track A keeps the names and runs them through Wine; Track B maps them in toolchain-linux.json |
| `StartsWith($sdk + '\')` manifest path check | Build.ps1 L342 | `os.sep` prefix check |
| `StartsWith($root + '\build\')` object directory guard | Build.ps1 L364 | `os.sep` prefix check, honouring `--build-root` |
| `app/synth` exclusion with `'\'` suffix | Build.ps1 L357 | `os.sep` prefix check |
| `Sort-Object FullName` (culture-sensitive) | Build.ps1 L357, L401 | ordinal sort; proven correct by reproducing the official build_id (`--identity-sort culture` kept for reference) |
| 22 Windows toolchain hashes | sdk/manifest.json, sdk/synth.json | Track A: enforced unchanged. Track B: replaced by `tools/linux/toolchain-linux.json`; every SDK file check and every synth.json check except the installed-compiler hash remains |
| `curl.exe`, `tar.exe`, Windows WASI SDK | Build-Web.ps1 L51-L55 | Linux WASI SDK 27 pinned (Step 6) |
| CRLF in the official kit's app files | official source zip | Documented in section 5; the fork keeps LF and therefore a different build_id; no change to app/ |
| Absolute source paths in the ELF symbol table | Build.ps1 L360-L370 (compile command) | Same behaviour on Linux; package unaffected (section 5, determinism) |
